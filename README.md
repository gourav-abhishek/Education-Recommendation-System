## Features

- Hybrid recommendation combining collaborative filtering (TensorFlow.js matrix factorization) and content-based filtering (cosine similarity)
- Real-time model training and prediction entirely in-browser using CDN libraries
- Sample dataset with 20 courses and 50 users with ratings and completion data
- Interactive UI with Bootstrap 5 and elegant visualization via Plotly.js
- Dynamic learning path generation considering prerequisites and difficulty levels
- Responsive and modern design featuring glassmorphism styling
- Clear explanations and recommendation source indicators (Collaborative, Content-Based, Hybrid)

## Getting Started

1. Open the live demo link above or download the source and open `index.html` locally.
2. Select a user profile from the dropdown or choose ‚ÄúNew User‚Äù for a cold-start experience.
3. View user‚Äôs past course ratings and completions.
4. Click **Generate Recommendations** to train the model and get personalized course recommendations.
5. Explore course details, similarity heatmaps, and suggested learning paths.
